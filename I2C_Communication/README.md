# I2C communication using 2 Arduino Uno

In this example, 2 arduinos are used to transmit data via I2C protocol.

The wire library is used to configure the I2C communication between both arduinos. The task is as follows:

1. One Arduino Uno is connected to a button via an interrupt pin.
2. Once the button is pressed, it transmits the ASCII code equivalent to the number of times the button was pressed.
3. The receiver Arduino Uno gets the number and shows it in the LCD screen, using the LCD library.
