# Application to multiply two matrices

Here you will practice:

1. Matrices
2. Pointers
3. Pinters to pointers
4. Passing multidimensional arrays by reference
5. Using for loops to multiply to matrices
6. Dynamic memory allocation

Matrix A is NxM
Matrix B is MxQ
---

- User inputs the dimensions of Matrix A
- Applications automatically gets the number of rows for Matrix B to avoid user error
- User inputs only the number of columns for Matrix B
- Both matrices are printed
- Both matrices are multiplied and the result is printed

## The application currently works, but still needs improvement to overcome the
## limitations from scanf
