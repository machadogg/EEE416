# A possible solution for the C Class Test

Write a program which gives out a report for chicken virus spreading statistics. Submit the c Code. 

 Partial grading will be done on incomplete code. So, please submit your incomplete code if you are unable to complete.

The user inputs two dates (month and year only):

1) Month and year of the first reported case of chicken virus in a poultry.

2) Month and year till which you would like to see the predicted statistics.

For each month in-between these dates, the program should print the 

1) Total number of cases reported

2) Total number of chicken which die

3) Total number of recovered chicken. 

The virus spreads based on the following rules:

1. Initial cases are 10.       

2. Each chicken spreads the virus to 3 other chickens in a day.

2. 90% of the chickens will recover after 1 day from when they have got virus. Rest of them die.

(assume every month has 30 days).
